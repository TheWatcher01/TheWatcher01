# About Me

**Teddy Deberdt** ‚Äì Journeying Towards Full-Stack Expertise

---

At 35, residing in the historic heart of Toulouse, I find myself at a pivotal juncture in my professional path. With a solid foundation of 15 years in vehicle maintenance and diagnostics, I‚Äôve cultivated a detail-oriented and analytical mindset. Driven by a desire for continuous growth, I recently embarked on a career transition to bridge my extensive technical background with modern development skills.

**Educational Pathway:** I am currently a student at Holberton School Toulouse, a place where my passion for coding and technology is both challenged and nurtured. Surviving the intensive introductory phase known as 'Hyppocamp' was a testament to my resilience and commitment to my new direction in IT.

**Technical Background:** Since my teenage years, I‚Äôve been captivated by the intricacies of IT diagnostics, maintenance, and the potential of technology to solve complex problems. My experience spans from building custom PCs to exploring network and system administration, workflow automation, OSINT, and cybersecurity. These areas reflect my broad interests and dedication to understanding the full spectrum of IT.

**Professional Aspirations:** I am on the lookout for an apprenticeship in Development (DevOps), eager to apply and further my analytical skills and technical knowledge in a practical, impactful setting. My goal is to integrate my foundational understanding of hardware with new software development skills to contribute effectively in a full-stack IT role.

**Skills and Interests:**

- **Hardware:** Experienced in custom PC, network, and server deployment, maintenance, and administration, with a knack for hardware optimization techniques such as overclocking and benchmarking.
  
- **Software:** Skilled in system and network administration, with interests in back-end development, data mining (scraping), automating workflows, and managing databases using SQL. I‚Äôm passionate about crafting solutions that streamline and enhance processes.

- **Programming Languages:** Actively learning and applying C, Python, JavaScript, Bash, HTML/CSS3, along with Git for version control. My journey with these technologies, although in its early stages, is marked by a keen enthusiasm to master them and apply them in real-world scenarios.

- **Cybersecurity:** Knowledgeable in using Kali Linux, Parrot OS, and employing OSINT tools and techniques. I am keen on contributing to the security and integrity of digital systems.

As I navigate through this transition, my aim is not only to acquire new skills but to also contribute meaningfully to projects and initiatives that leverage technology for progress and innovation.

**Let's Connect:** I am open to discussions and opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and grow. Let‚Äôs explore how we can collaborate on technology-driven projects and make a positive impact together.
